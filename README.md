# Starfinders

Interactive character sheets for DM use for the Starfinder role playing game. _This is not a character generator._

## How does this work?

Create a character sheet for your players. Assuming you have a copy of their character sheet, copy over the pertinent values. Many of the values will automatically fill and do the math for you, saving time and effort.

You can have as many characters as you wish, but remember to save your characters frequently. Saving stores the data in `localStorage` so closing your browser or dumping your storage will delete your data.

Optionally, you can export your save to a file, and import it later to continue.

## Why?

Mainly for me. As nice as PDFs are, I don't like using them for character sheets during online games. I'd prefer an actual sheet or something digital. I chose the latter because I wanted a weekend project for myself. And I decided to make it open source in case anyone else gets the itch too!
